# Omni MCP Hub Configuration
# Comprehensive configuration for CLAUDE.md file management, auto-loading, and scanning

# Auto-loading configurations on server startup
autoLoad:
  # List of CLAUDE.md configurations to automatically load when the server starts
  # This is useful for having your preferred configurations ready immediately
  profiles:
    # Example configuration entry (remove or modify as needed):
    # - name: "my-config"              # Unique name for this configuration
    #   path: "./path/to/config.md"    # Path to CLAUDE.md file (relative or absolute)
    #   autoApply: true                # Whether to automatically apply this config
    #                                  # true = load and apply immediately
    #                                  # false = load but don't apply (manual activation needed)

# File scanning and filtering settings
fileSettings:
  # Custom file name patterns for different types of configuration files
  # These patterns are used when auto-scanning directories for CLAUDE.md files
  configFiles:
    claude: "CLAUDE.md"        # Standard CLAUDE.md configuration files
    behavior: "*-behavior.md"  # Files ending with -behavior.md (e.g., pirate-behavior.md)
    custom: "*-config.md"      # Files ending with -config.md (e.g., my-config.md)
  
  # Directories to include when auto-scanning for configuration files
  # Only files in these directories will be automatically discovered
  includePaths:
    - "./examples/"            # Example configurations
    - "./configs/"             # Main configuration directory
    - "./profiles/"            # User profile configurations
  
  # File and directory patterns to exclude from scanning
  # Use glob patterns (* = any characters, ** = any directories)
  excludePatterns:
    - "*.tmp"                  # Temporary files
    - "*.backup"               # Backup files
    - "*~"                     # Editor backup files
    - ".git/**"                # Git repository files
    - "node_modules/**"        # Node.js dependencies
    - "dist/**"                # Build output directory
    - "*.log"                  # Log files
  
  # File extensions that are allowed for CLAUDE.md configuration files
  # Files with other extensions will be ignored during scanning
  allowedExtensions:
    - ".md"                    # Markdown files (standard)
    - ".markdown"              # Alternative markdown extension
    - ".txt"                   # Plain text files

# Directory scanning behavior
directoryScanning:
  # Whether to scan subdirectories recursively
  # true = scan all subdirectories, false = only scan top-level directory
  recursive: true
  
  # Maximum directory depth to scan (prevents infinite recursion)
  # 0 = unlimited depth, 1 = only top level, 2 = one level deep, etc.
  maxDepth: 3
  
  # Whether to include hidden files and directories (starting with .)
  # true = include .hidden-config.md, false = skip hidden files
  includeHidden: false
  
  # Whether to follow symbolic links during scanning
  # true = follow symlinks (can cause infinite loops), false = ignore symlinks
  followSymlinks: false

# Profile and configuration management
profileManagement:
  # Whether to allow multiple configurations with the same name
  # true = allow duplicates, false = reject duplicate names
  allowDuplicateNames: false
  
  # Pattern for automatically generating profile names from file paths
  # Available variables: %filename%, %dirname%, %path%
  # Examples:
  #   "%filename%" -> "my-config" (from my-config.md)
  #   "%dirname%_%filename%" -> "profiles_my-config" (from profiles/my-config.md)
  autoNamePattern: "%filename%"
  
  # Default profile name to use when none is specified
  defaultProfile: "default"

# Logging and debugging options
logging:
  # Log level for console output
  # "debug" = all messages, "info" = normal messages, "warn" = warnings only, "error" = errors only
  level: "info"
  
  # Show detailed messages when loading configuration files
  # true = show "âœ… Loaded config: path/to/file.md", false = silent loading
  verboseFileLoading: true
  
  # Show detailed messages when switching between profiles
  # true = show profile activation messages, false = silent switching
  verboseProfileSwitching: true
